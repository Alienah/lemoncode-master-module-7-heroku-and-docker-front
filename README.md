# lemoncode-master-module-7-heroku-and-docker-front

This is a simple frontend app created with React. In this project we have created a docker image with this app and we have deployed it in heroku using github actions.

We have started from a boilerplate created by [MÃ¡ster Front End Online Lemoncode](https://lemoncode.net/master-frontend#inicio-banner) team.
